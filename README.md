# OpenRock-MolangSafe

A validated Molang-expression builder encoding real, in-game-confirmed client-crashing patterns (no >=, no bare '', no division on a string-typed property) as both a validator and safe builder functions.

Part of the [OpenRock](https://github.com/codex-alchemist-dev/OpenRock) Minecraft Bedrock mod-packaging ecosystem - a Codex Alchemist project, under Fireball Everything. Consumed as a real git submodule at `libs/molang-safe` in the main OpenRock repo, and directly `npm require`/`import`-able (real top-level CommonJS exports, esbuild-CJS/ESM-interop-compatible) by any mod's own build-time kernel registration or real in-game script.
